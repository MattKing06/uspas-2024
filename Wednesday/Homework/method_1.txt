maximum accelerating phase [deg] = -178
zero accelerating phase [deg] = max_acc_phase - 90 = -268
delta phi max = 60.15 (after cosine fit on rf vs bpm phase data)
fitted phase_offset[deg] =  -2.413

calculated time using:
t = (zero_acc_bpm_phase - phase_offset) / bpm_frequency
time of flight [s] = 1.7158232735173712e-08

delta_beta = L_dist/(t*c) - beta_init = -0.0242

Not sure where to go from here to calculate Veff.
